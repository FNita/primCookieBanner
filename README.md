# primCookieBanner
A simple cookie banner you can add to static HTML websites, which means you can add it to any website. Developed for [primsite.net](https://primsite.net/).

# Why?
Because most of the cookie banners available online are either paid or don't let you fully customize them.

# How does it function?
- Shows a cookie banner when you load the website.
- It has 3 toggle buttons for:
  1. Strictly necessary cookies (always on and disabled so that users can't change them)
  2. Advertising cookies (users can toggle them on or off)
  3. Analytics cookies (users can toggle them on or off)
- Different scripts are loaded based on the user's preferences. You can add your code/scripts for each toggle and it will load only if the user activates the respective toggle and hits the "Accept" button.

# How to install it?
1. Add the JavaScript code from script.js to your website's main JavaScript file.
2. Add the CSS code from the style.css to your website's main CSS file.
3. Add the HTML code from the index.html in your website's footer so it will be available on the entire website.
